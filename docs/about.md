Hello and welcome! I’m so happy to have you here.

My name is Alysha and I’m a multi-passionate mompreneur who works mostly from home with my toddler in southern Oregon. I’ve learned that running multiple businesses, meeting work deadlines, and chasing career dreams while also raising littles and maintaining the home can be incredibly challenging. Doing all of that while walking through the postpartum season and living with inattentive ADHD and anxiety adds another fun layer of struggle to my days.

Along my journey, I’ve discovered a love for connecting with and encouraging other entrepreneurial moms. I remember feeling so isolated early on and sought out podcasts to try to feel seen. I never found one that combined everything that I was looking for, so I started my own podcast with the goal of encouraging others. I’ve learned so much and my hope is to save you time and to help your journey to be less messy. I enjoy sharing stories of navigating the highs and lows of entrepreneurship while also raising babies. Read or listen here for insights and tips on managing mompreneur life including productivity, time management, self-care, marketing, content creation, meal planning, home-making and parenting in general while building your business.

If you prefer to listen to the podcast episodes on your favorite podcast platform, I’d be so grateful if you’d take a minute to subscribe to the show and leave a 5-star review. If you’d share this podcast with others that may find it helpful, that would be incredibly appreciated as I’d love to reach more overwhelmed moms! I’d also really love to connect with you on social media. Shoot me a DM or an email with any specific topics you want to hear more about, or questions that you’d like me to ask fellow mompreneurs during guest interviews. You can find me on most platforms with the handle @messymompreneur. I’ll share my contact info in the show notes as well.
