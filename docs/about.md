Hello and welcome to the Messy Mompreneur podcast! I’m so happy to have you here!

My name is Alysha Sanford and I’m your show host. I’m a newer, first-time, work-at-home-mama navigating the highs and lows of entrepreneurship. I have a photography studio in Roseburg, Oregon as well as a small baby and toddler goods shop. Over the last year and a half, I’ve learned that running a business, meeting work deadlines and chasing career dreams while also raising littles and maintaining the home can be so challenging. Doing all of this while living with inattentive ADHD adds another interesting layer.

On this podcast, we’ll touch on all relatable aspects of mompreneur life, including productivity, time management, tips and hacks, self-care, marketing, home-making and parenting in general.

You’ll hear experiences and advice from fellow mompreneurs, other inspiring guests and some industry experts as well. We’ll be having conversations about the messy, the tough and the beautiful. I want to give a voice to others who might be struggling and, as an introvert, I want to get more comfortable with my own voice. I also want you to listen, feel seen and finish each episode feeling a sense of encouragement and community.

If you haven’t already, I’d be so grateful if you’d take a minute to subscribe to the podcast and leave a review. If you’d share this podcast with other’s that may find it helpful, that would also be incredibly appreciated. I’d really love to connect with you on social media! Shoot me a DM with any specific topics you want to hear more about or questions that you’d like me to ask fellow mompreneurs during guest interviews. You can find me on most platforms with the handle @messymompreneur. I’ll share my contact info in the show notes as well.
