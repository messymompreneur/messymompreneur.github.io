Hello and welcome to the Messy Mompreneur podcast! I’m so happy to have you here!

My name is Alysha Sanford and I’m your show host.

I’m a newer, first-time, work-at-home-mama navigating the highs and lows of entrepreneurship. Running a business, working full time, or chasing career dreams in general while also raising littles and maintaining the home can be so challenging. Especially if you don’t have a strong, local support system or aren’t great about asking for help. I personally struggle with that last one.

On this podcast, I plan to touch on all aspects of mompreneur life, including productivity, time management, tips and hacks, self-care, marketing, home-making and parenting in general.

I want to give a voice to others who might be struggling and, as an introvert, I want to get more comfortable with my own voice. This will likely be an audio only show because I know that most of you are likely multitasking while listening. I also want to be able to accommodate any guests on the show who’d prefer to stay somewhat private.

You’ll hear from fellow mompreneurs, other inspiring guests and eventually I hope to chat with some industry experts as well. We’ll be having conversations about the messy, the tough and the beautiful. I want you to listen, feel seen and finish each episode feeling a sense of encouragement and community.

If you haven’t already, I’d be so grateful if you’d take a minute to subscribe to the podcast and leave a review. If you’d share this podcast with other’s that may find it helpful, that would also be incredibly appreciated. I’d really love to connect with you on social media! Shoot me a DM with any specific topics you want to hear more about or questions that you’d like me to ask fellow mompreneurs during guest interviews. You can find me on most platforms with the handle @messymompreneur. I’ll share my contact info in the show notes as well.
