To our listeners & past guests,

With heartfelt gratitude and a touch of optimism, we're pausing the podcast for now. Navigating through both the upcoming busy season and the uncertainties of health within my family has reminded us of the importance of spending cherished moments with loved ones. As we reflect, recharge, and imagine what's next, weâ€™re immensely thankful to each of you who've shared in our episodes.

To my wonderful husband, your dedication to producing these 16 episodes is what made this passion project possible.

Though the future isn't fully clear, I still hope to be able to continue sharing the stories of fellow mompreneurs. So, for now, a sincere thank you, a pause and a hope that this is just a chapter break. Stay tuned for more!

Thank you,

Alysha
