### Episode Transcription

Speaker 1

Hello and welcome back to the Messy Mompreneur podcast. I'm your host, Alysha Sanford, and I'm so happy to have you here today. I'm chatting with RaeAnn of Sweet Macaraes. If you are in the Roseburg OR area, you might be familiar with her. She has a super cute dessert shop where she. Offers a specialty of handcrafted and delicious French macarons in a variety of flavors, and she has new flavors that circulate each month, so it's kind of fun to keep up with her in that aspect. She is going to be. Sharing everything that she currently offers, as well as some exciting things coming up, and I am so excited for you to get to hear from her. I'm also really loving chatting, especially with local mompreneurs I feel like every week I'm seeing a new mom chase their dreams. And either pursue a business or pivot in a way that is new and exciting to them in their existing business. And I just want to cheer them on because pursuing entrepreneurship and raising a family and managing the House, all those things it is, it's really hard. It is a balancing act and I just love hearing from each mom. Her unique experience, things that have worked for her, things that she's excited about. I just love amplifying that. And anyway, without further ado, let's chat with RayAnn. Hi, RayAnn. Thank you so much for joining me today.

Speaker 2

Hi, I'm happy to be here. Thank you for having me.

Speaker 1

To kick it off, can you tell us a little bit about yourself and your family?

Speaker 2

So I've lived in our small town of Roseburg, my. Pretty much my whole. Life short stint out of college. I married my. Husband my high school sweetheart. We got married very young at 19. And somehow we're still, we're still struggling along. We were hitting. I think we'll be 18 years this year, Mary, which is mind boggling, but it's great. He's my. Best friend so. We have two kiddos, 2 boys. 12 and almost 14. So they keep us. Pretty busy at this. This phase is different kind of busy from the little phase. So, but they're lovely and we get to watch. Them grow into these awesome humans, so it's good.

Speaker 1

So can you tell us a little bit about your journey into motherhood and then also? Entrepreneurship I get. I guess I just want to know which came first and when you started to have to blend both worlds and how that went.

Speaker 2

So kind of kind of blend through world because I actually have a part a full time job on top of my entrepreneurship. But it's fun we. So I was a younger mom. I think by today's date. So I had the boys when I was in my mid 20s. And loved that had a lot of energy with them. I when they were younger. Childcare was always a struggle. And I loved working. I learned at a young age when they were. I want to say my second or as a year and a half, I needed to work. I stayed home with them for a little while and it wasn't an ideal. Situation for me to work from home. I needed the. The outlets of. You know interactions. With adults, but also just. Need to feel like myself. So I went back to work part time at 1st and then went back to full time, but realized that I needed a little more flexibility. I was missing out on some. Of the moments that. When, especially when they. Started school, so I always worked. Jobs that were kind of. Front desk focused, which I loved. Customer service focused, but I was always kind. Of chained to a. Desk kind of with how it felt to me. So I decided to go back. To school in. My late 20s so that I could hopefully get a job that offered me a little more flexibility to be able to kind of come and go as I. Needed so kind of best of both worlds. And here we are now. So I work full time. I manage a communications marketing department at my, at my job. And my husband works full time as well for our local dairy. He's been there for 15 years. Been a while. So we both just really, it's it's, never not a struggle, right? Mom guilt is still always a real thing. Yeah. So that's kind. Of how and then the. Cookies came along honestly by chance. I was wanted to like, learn how to make this really stubborn. Cookie macarons are not something that I was successful at when I. Started and once I got it down. My husband was like. Hey, you know, maybe people want to buy these. These are great little things to add to events or just to have, you know, we don't have anything like. This in Roseburg. I joke around all the time that. Roseburg deserves nice things, so here comes the macaron and I just kind of put out a post and said hey. He wants to buy some macarons for Easter and. That was over a year ago. And so here we are. They've been lovely and I love them. They're like my little like. They're like another child.

Speaker 1

So you OK? So your full time job is that like I'm sorry if you said it already. It's Monday through Friday full time. Do you work weekends only for the Macron business or are you working, pulling late nights, that sort of thing, too?

Speaker 2

Yes, lots of late nights, depending on the week, mostly weekends. For sure so, but by the time I get to the weekends, a lot of times, that's when I'm handing out orders, some orders or I do a monthly box, so I pay them out on Saturdays a lot of times, or if I have an event. That I'm going to be at a market or something, so a lot of the work does happen during the week after work after homework. So yeah, it's definitely a balancing act and it at this point it you know I'm limited on what I can take and, and want to expand. More once we get to a. Certain point, but yeah, for now this is this is the life. Good one to have so.

Speaker 1

So is it currently just you doing all of it alone? The baking, the marketing, the fulfillment, all of that.

Speaker 2

Yes and no. Yes, 90% of it. My husband on the weekends, so. I recently added in. So I bake out. Of a commercial kitchen. On, especially on the weekends, on their most weekends baking and my productivity has gone way up there because I can. Bake way faster in their oven. What? My husband. I cannot undervalue his support and help, especially in the kitchen and it seems simple. Like he washed the dishes, a lot of a lot of time. But that is such a time saver for me to be able to. Just focus on prepping and getting the batter and everything ready to go in the cookies in the oven, he. It's funny because even just like being able to. Run like him. Or get his input on a design, on a post or whatever. He's that guy. So am I physically doing or actually? Yeah, but we cannot. Undervalue the support that I get from him for sure.

Speaker 1

I'm glad to hear that. He's so supportive and enthusiastic because I, you know, you don't always see that with mom, well, mompreneurs. You know, sometimes the dad's just kind of like, oh, it's just a hobby. But that's awesome that he's really pushing, pushing you to grow.

Speaker 2

Yeah, I think. He would love to see it go. He was the one. That kind of pushed me. Into it initially, you know. I mean, I definitely second guessed myself from the beginning. And he was. Like, just go for it, just try it. So he's kind of like my confidence, if you will. He's been like that.

Speaker 1

I was just going to say cheerleader. I love it. So we're coming into summer, which I want to talk about a couple different aspects of with you, but would you consider summer your busiest season? I know it's wedding season here where we live for sure, but I wondered if it's busier than the holiday.

Speaker 2

Not for me yet. I definitely have quite a few more weddings this year than I did last year. I think it. Is going to be busier for. Me because I'm adding in. The farmers market this summer, so that's new. So I will have a steady sort of, if you will. His pseudo store fronts that I have to prep for, I am going to take it slow as this is my first season. So every two weeks instead of 1, so at least for July, and then we'll see where. We are in August but. But at the same time it's also. It's also a laid back season for us because the. Boys are out of school. School season is more structured in the way, but it's also. They're older, so they don't have to go to all the things, and I love to give them the summer time, rest and restore and just kind of do things that they want to do versus have to do. We still have some routine and a few. Camps that they'll go to but, so yeah, and I think for the cookies, I think we might be a little busier. But home life will also slow down, so I think. It's going to even out a little bit. I say that and it. Might it might be wrong.

Speaker 1

Well, you just answered my next question. So that's awesome. I was going to ask how the summer break is affected by kids home in school, but that's nice to hear that it kind of. I don't know it the. It's like a balance. Yeah, and it shifts.

Speaker 2

Yeah, I I'd love to get him more involved in the business this summer, kind of like there. I it's not so necessarily, I want them to sort of see have an example of what you know, not only what I'm doing and this is you know another piece of working I think that example but, you know, this is they could do something in, in their own way, you know, like I my well, this is going to be 14 in, in a few weeks and, you know, tell you could you could dog sit or house sit, you know, like we will drive you there, you know. I still have to be involved. Just sort of opening their eyes up to that. What works kind of so. They can't work yet for real but what that responsibility, right?

Speaker 1

Yeah, well, and just introducing him to taking pride in something that. Is a responsibility also. The perfect age. So task wise like as far as household business day job, anything in between, is there anything that you have outsourced that you have no regrets about? And if not, is there something that you would like to outsource in the near future that would really? Help with time management and like productivity.

Speaker 2

Yeah. So business wise, I. I work in marketing. This is something I work in marketing, but I did outsource my own marketing, my own branding, which I have zero regrets about for the business. Sometimes I think for me at least, I get too close to the project and it's hard for me to sort of. Did a good clear picture. I know what I want, but how do I get that out to or relay that out to my customer so? I did that a couple ways I had. Some brand photos done by. Erin Audiss, whom I know we both really enjoy. She did a great job and. And then yeah, I had my branding done. By a local Gallup in Corvallis. Don't regret that would be. I think it was worth every penny. In the future. Business wise, I'd love to outsource my website, probably within the next year. Because that is a headache. Unnecessary, but I care about and I. I really want it to be something. That's easy, easier for my, for my customers, for my, the people that are, wanting to either buy for me or do an event or whatever so. And then home-wise gosh, I think. If uh, I think if, we have, my Husband, I've always talked about this and we just need to do it. I think we might. Actually implement this over the summer I'd. Love to have somebody come in and like clean once a month. Because I think we are very busy and the boys you know, I feel like I'm just a taxi sometimes. For them, getting them from point A to 50, but there's not enough time in the day often to do the big chores like cleaning the floors or, gosh, the bathrooms. About how much I hate cleaning back. So just things like that, so nothing like. I think when I was younger, I used to. Think that the whole. Gosh house cleaner. Such a big deal. And as a mom now, I'm like, yeah. It's not a big. Deal that is just practical. We all deserve that. So we'll see if that works, but. Yeah, that would be something that would do.

Speaker 1

Be a dream. Oh my God. That's an aspiration of mine too. Just a tiny bit of a of a of a reset once a month that I can just like leave and come back to.

Speaker 2

I'm like, yeah. And then keep maintaining. I feel like maintaining sometimes even like. Doing the like. If you can get them to. Do laundry I.

Speaker 1

You know I. Hear I hear laundry is like ohh a pain point for a lot of moms. And for me it's dishes because we're doing them by hand. And I referenced that a few times, so listeners probably already know this and they might be annoyed by me saying that. But laundry I don't. I don't hate yet, but I know that there will come a day that I'm just rolling my eyes and dreading it.

Speaker 2

I wonder sometimes if you get to a certain. Point as a. Mom, where you? Maybe expect or want your kids to start. Taking on more. And that can lead to a pain. Point I think we're my kids are learning that responsibility. Of like chores or, you know, just taking care of themselves. And so it feels like they should be there, but they're not there and that's fine. But there's that. That having to repeat yourself, you know, at this point we're they're at 12 and 14. We've told them my husband and I told them a million times that, hey, we do showers every other night. And you still have to continually repeat yourself. So that can lead to some mental stress I feel like sometimes.

Speaker 1

Well, I'll quickly mention that if you can get them to a point where they do their own laundry. And I guess learn to maybe take, I don't know pride in it, I am married to a man who has always done his own laundry since he was a kid. Like I don't. I'm assuming his parents, you know, kind of made that the expectation, but he won't let me touch it because he doesn't want me to mess anything up. I am so appreciative that I don't have to deal with one extra load, so if they can bless the future partner in that way.

Speaker 2

Yes

Speaker 1

By doing your own laundry. It goes a long way.

Speaker 2

Moms of boys. Yes, moms of boys, we have that responsibility of making sure that they are equal contributors to their relationship, for sure. So that is my goal. I'd love for my future daughter-in-law to come. To me and.

Speaker 1

Say thank you. Can you tell me a little bit about your current like weekly routine or schedule or even just a rhythm? I know you're adding in the every other weekend. Farmers markets and so I guess I'm just wondering, is there anything that you are going to be implementing into your existing routine that's going to help with that extra deadline and production work?

Speaker 2

I think what will be easier, it's the weekends for me being able to go to the kitchen on the weekends and really that's going to be the biggest, I think new thing this summer is that I'm going to. Be able to really batch bake a lot quicker. Plan ahead my menus, that's something. Else that I do really well, so I have like my whole, I do new flavors every month so I have my whole menu like planned out, for the year right now. So I know you know, I can I can pre batch my marketing content. In Canada, for example, and. So I just I do a lot of batching I guess I batch bake. Batch create content. And then that way when I'm not. Working either at the stage or with cookies, I'm able to really focus in. When I'm at. Home and if the boys need something they need. Something they they're. Not as needy as they were when they. Were little, you know. Maybe sometimes I. Wish they were. But so they they're fairly self-reliant now, or they kind of secure themselves so. It's not so bad. It's every summer now I feel like. Going forward, it's just going. To be a little different. I needed less as a mom. And I think in the next two years, when my oldest. I guess that that gives me the capacity to do both really to be able. To do cookies and full time. It's not so bad. It's busy, but it's not bad.

Speaker 1

Well, yeah, you mentioned batch work and that is a game changer for sure. And I can only imagine with the baking and the mass production of delicious macarons, I, which by the way, I. I haven't ordered a box yet because I just recently discovered that you do the monthly boxes, which by the way I think is totally genius and exciting. It's some to look forward to. But I have had your amazing little artwork pieces at many like birthday parties, bridal showers, that sort of thing around our town and they're delicious. And they're so cute. You almost you don't want to eat them because they're so pretty. But of course, you know you're going to because you're delicious. I are you only. OK, so you mentioned your website and that you want it to be easier for your customers to place orders. Are you doing only local pickup and delivery or are you potentially looking into shipping? At any point.

Speaker 2

So that shipping is definitely something that will come at some point. I have the ability to do that now. That was the big goal to the kitchen. The commercial kitchen is now licensed. Do you still bake at home? But that's usually. Just customs and I mean to the customer, so organ. They in order to ship, you have to be licensed. With your food. But the thing with the macarons is they're super sensitive, you know, fragile little things. And I'd love to be able to have to receive their as I intended to like whole cookies, right? They're not over. So yes, short answer is yes, I will be offering shipping at some point, but definitely honing in on that local customer right now, getting that all settled. In and then. We'll move on from there. I've had people reach out though. Asking so I'm like, I want to but maybe someday, maybe soon.

Speaker 1

I get it, especially wanting to be able to quality control what they're receiving makes total sense.

Speaker 2

Yeah, I mean, it's going to taste good. But it may not look. I'm going to start. I will actually, I think in the next probably. The next few months I'm going to start testing. I have friends that live, gosh as far. As the east. So I'm going to ship them some. It's like, hey, tell me how these go. Know if they turn now.

Speaker 1

Yeah, that's a good idea. Kind of test it out before it's an offering. So I have a few more questions for you before we start to wrap up and these are questions that are fun ones to ask. The majority of my guests, because I like to get the. Variety of input and answers and feedback. So on a busy night. Or just one where you're getting home late. Do you have any go to dinners or meal plans or solutions for that for feeding the family when you just don't have? A ton of time.

Speaker 2

Yes, and air. It's called air fryer. It was just like an oven, but it makes so. You didn't airfare my instant. Pot, we're able to eat pretty good most nights. And there are many late nights, right? So yes, like, who's, like, game changer? Yeah, it that's they've been time savers and I trust my kids to use the air fryer if they wanted to make like chicken Nuggets for example. Something simple they can. I don't want them using the oven yet. They're, they're almost there, but the air fryer. And they got that. And I can go, OK. Put in some chicken nuggets for you and. You're all set so. Love my air fryer.

Speaker 1

Yeah, that seems like a great little appliance for having like teens and preteens in the house.

Speaker 2

Yes, imagine that. I imagine that college kids love it, too.

Speaker 1

Yeah

Speaker 2

It's like our, like, our version of Roman noodles. I may have dated myself.

Speaker 1

I think Roman, they're still, they're still a thing. Cup of noodles, all of that.

Speaker 2

Yes.

Speaker 1

I was wondering also, since you're very, very busy. A busy mompreneur, how do you take time to recharge? Is there anything specific that you like to do to? Take care of you. And how do you make time for?

Speaker 2

Yeah, I am books, my big reader, and obviously that's hard to do is when you're busy, but I have. I have a. Subscription to audible, so I do audio books. What I love? About books is that you know you. Just kind of. Escape life and you're able to just kind of. Go into a different place for a minute. I love reading like. I've recently been making time to sit down and actually read books recently and I forget how. Much, I love that, but. It isn't always practical, but audible I'm able to. Listen while I bake. A lot of times. Or while I'm folding laundry or doing dishes like doing these with my hands. If I do my hands. I can still. I can still engage in that, so it's definitely. Definitely I go to and then walking I. Go for walks. Don't underestimate a good walk, right? Both and I will take my kids with me. Sometimes I force them to force family fun time. And we will have great conversations on our walks. So never, I never regret going for a walk, even if I'm busy.

Speaker 1

Yeah, those are two great ways to unwind and justice. I don't know, reconnect with what's important. Yeah, that's awesome. So. If you had an additional free hour for TV time at night, do you happen to have any favorite TV shows or guilty pleasures?

Speaker 2

Yeah, we, uh, I love a good like reality TV show. A lot of the. Stuff we watch at night. I still kind. Of regarded with the boys watch so. I it they're not bad. But I just don't. Want the boys necessarily taking that stuff in yet? So but my go to always has been for. Probably at least a. Decade has been friends. I really have HBO Max. Just so that I can continually go back, I must have watched the entire series. I mean easily. At least 20 times I will take a break for like a few months and then I will go and restart and it is a running joke. In my house that gives me. All kinds of grief about it. And I have. It memorized anyway. It's my go to. I will never not be a lover or friends. Even most of this stuff, when there's sometimes things. He goes, I believe they said that. It's still funny so. Here we are.

Speaker 1

I am so excited that you just said that because friends, I haven't watched it 20 times, but maybe closer to 10. 10 and my most recent time was about a year ago, so I'm definitely overdue because I would take a few months off and go back to it, and for whatever reason it's a comfort show and it seems to time out every time around the holidays. You're watching holiday episodes because they, of course, their seasons are much faster than your actual year, and it's just so comforting. And it's so funny and it's just. It's such a gem of a show, and my husband ironically also is so annoyed that I watch it too frequently in his mind. And he's also the one that does all the tech work and editing of these episodes. And so he's going to hear you say that. And I feel so validated.

Speaker 2

So good I.

Speaker 1

Don't you know?

Speaker 2

It is. It is a.

Speaker 1

Don't be a hater, right?

Speaker 2

It is a comfort show. I mean, I think it's one of those things I don't even necessarily have to watch it now. I'll be in the kitchen baking and have it on in the background and I can't necessarily see the TV and my husband's like, why? Why are you watching this right now or not watching it? It's like they're there with me. They're in the room, hanging out. Yeah, that's weird.

Speaker 1

That's what it is. Well, that's awesome. And then if you could go back and tell yourself something as a tired, fresh first time parent. What would it be?

Speaker 2

Yeah. So actually. I have like a whole like I. Could write a whole essay on this. Gosh, I love my kids, but I did not necessarily enjoy the young years. I see that carefully because of course, but they're just they were so hard for me. I think looking back, I know that I got easily. Just overstimulated by, you know, the noise and the constant. Touching and you know, I was just. I was just like. Obviously we did totally great and the boys and I, I appreciate all of the time I spent with them because we have a great relationship now. But yes, there are. A couple of things I have thought about this first. Phases are a real thing. These are things that I. Was told that when I was. When they were little. And I thought, oh, it's so cliche, but they're phases or phases. And they come and go. I think they go before you even realize that they're gone and we still. Deal with faces like. We're in phases all the time. I think our phase is now just lasts a little longer, but the number one thing I would tell myself, I'll stop rambling. Is that we are a. Whole human being outside of our kids. Gosh, we, I mentioned mom guilt before and it is. It's a real thing. And I think it's. Really easy to kind of get caught up in. I don't know. You just want everything to be OK. Especially your kids, you know and. We forget ourselves. I was. I am a young mom. Still, I guess technically, given that my kids are, you know. Getting pretty close to that. Adult age and you were within. Within five years of our oldest being an 18. And I'm going to. Be in my early 40s when they're both graduated and I have a whole life after that, right? Like, that's not very. Old because I felt old when I was younger, but it doesn't feel old now. I'm going, I'm going to have a whole life to, you know, do things and be me outside of them while they're going out and making their whole worlds. And I don't want to end up at. That point sort of a shell of a. Human you know. And so I think it's. OK. For us to give ourselves grace and time, I love how you ask. The question what do you enjoy doing? How do you spend time? Renewing yourself or your giving yourself. What do you like because? We lose that stuff sometimes, so to each. Their own, of course. I'm a big believer in. That, but yeah, I think. I would just. Say like it's OK, it's OK to leave the kids and go. Have fun with. Your girlfriends for a night. It's OK to take a minute to believe if they're having a temper tantrum or whatever the case is, you're not. Going to break. Them and everything's going to be OK and you're going to be OK. So but, it is, yeah, It's just hard. But yeah, that's fine. We're human beings.

Speaker 1

Thank you for sharing all of that. I feel a little selfish because I'm kind of on the receiving end a lot being in the thick of it with the young toddler. So I you know, I soak up all this advice to be honest, but I am hoping that any listeners hearing that will. Also, really enjoy the reminder that it's OK to be a whole person as well as a mom. Not just one or the other.

Speaker 2

Yes, yes. Gosh. We love our kids. We love our kids, but we. I mean, our kids are going to get nothing from us if we don't also like ourselves and do what we need to do too, so. I'll be your cheerleader.

Speaker 1

Well, as we wrap up, do you have anything that you are really looking forward to in the next couple of years? Any big goals or projects in the work with your family, home, work and business? I know you shared a little bit, but maybe anything that you're. You mentioned the farmers. I'm sorry the farmers market, but also the Arts festival, so stuff like that, I'd love to hear about.

Speaker 2

So more events for sure. I would love to turn. I'd love the cookies to turn into. More of a part time. Part time, sorry not working full time necessarily, but. I do love my job too, so I guess one of those people that kind. Of wants it all, but yeah. I'd love to see the. Cookies just grow. I it's, it's true. Been such an amazing experience being you know. Having my own business and. I'd love to see it just do more, you know, short term, kind of within the next year, hoping to get more of a the sort of a presence at events. So think like maybe a trailer or something or a rentable like cute little dessert cart. So these are things that are rolling around. Some of them are kind of have tiny little feats, but we're putting together some ideas for that, but yeah, lots. Lots more events. I have the farmers or the farmers working in the. First festival this summer, but then you know Christmas fair stuff like that. So I just want to offer people a cute, delicious, pretty dessert that, you know, it's just, it's something fun, it's pretty and it's, it's just a nice thing to be able to have so. I do a lot of events. So I'd love to do more weddings. In the next year, I'd love to be your, your go-to wedding person. Hit me up.

Speaker 1

For sure I used to be a wedding photographer and I am so sad that we just, you know, sort of missed paths as far as working events because I'm it's been a little while since I got out of that world a little bit, but. I would have absolutely loved. I was big on photographing details and I'm telling you, if you put a giant tower of macarons in front of me, I would have been at that table photographing it for probably way longer than I should. Have been but. They're so pretty. It's just it's such a fun. Like a fun, joyful niche. Option that you bring to our area and I just love it and I love seeing your name more and more frequently and seeing your little art pieces on display tables. They're so cute.

Speaker 2

That means a lot. We'll see where it goes, hopefully, hopefully more and more, and I'd love to be. Able to offer more like French treats in the future. What we're doing with the French thing to think croissants and mummies like that, but all homemade with that touch that I think just adds a little something so.

Speaker 1

Well, if you'd like to allow any listeners to follow or connect with you if they don't already, can you tell us where to find you and how to find your, find your website and all that.

Speaker 2

Yeah, so I'm on Instagram and Facebook very, very heavy on Instagram. Sweet Macaraes. So it's sweet, underscore macaraes on Instagram and then Sweet Macaraes if you search more Facebook and then same with the website and dub dub dub sweet macaraes dot com. You'll find, where, that's where I have people go when they want to fill out like an event form. But you can also just send me a message. If you have questions too, so.

Speaker 1

Well, we'll put those links in the show notes, so it's a quick click for any listeners so they don't have to go type it in, they'll get there faster.

Speaker 2

Perfect.
