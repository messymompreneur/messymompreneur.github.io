### Episode Transcription

Speaker 1

Hello and welcome back to the Messy Mompreneur podcast. I'm your host, Alysha Sanford, and I'm so happy to have you here today. We're chatting with my friend Karissa Pangelina. I met Karissa over a decade ago now and that was back when she hired me for her oldest daughters. Six month photo session. Since then I've had the honor of photographing. Many more special milestones for their family through the years and developing a friendship with her. She's an incredibly sweet and hard working wife, Mama of two and a successful realtor here in Roseburg. She's sharing her journey today into motherhood and her career, and I'm excited for you to listen. Hi Karissa. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm so excited to have you on as we start. Can you share a little bit about yourself and your family?

Speaker 2

Hi yes, so I am a real estate agent here in Roseburg. I've lived. Here my whole life besides. Leaving for college and meeting my husband. We've been together for. 15 years now, married for 11:00 and we have two little girls, Cameron and Pearson. And they are 12:00 and 7:00. And they keep us pretty busy, Alan just recently changed jobs. So a lot of people know him around town, from Applebee's and Costco. But now he's kind of more hidden away, so he's out at Caddock Electronics now. So nice.

Speaker 1

OK, so I want to also hear a bit about your journey into motherhood. So let's start there and then we'll work towards. Your journey into your career now.

Speaker 2

OK, so my dream and to. Motherhood was a. Little bit surprising for the first one. And then. You know, we had Cameron and then we decided, OK, yeah, we do want to have another child after, you know, deciding, maybe we. One and then. OK, yeah. We do want two and. Then it took. A little while, you know, we struggled to get pregnant the second time and. Had kind of a journey there and it was a struggle for about 5 years. We struggled. And then finally. Got pregnant with little Pearson so she is our spicy, sassy little one that made everyone wait for her, you know. Second child to a tee. So I always wanted to be a mom and it was. It's just, it's so much fun and. I love those little girls. Even though they test me to. My limit some days they're so much fun. They keep us busy for sure though.

Speaker 1

So at the time you were. OK, I'm trying to think timeline wise at the time that you guys were trying for Pearson, what were you doing for work and did you have a goal in mind as far as your ideal career at that point.

Speaker 2

So I was working in dental at that time. I had been in dental for several years. Uh, a couple of different companies. But yeah, so I was. Doing like billing and reception type work at a billing. Or at a dental. Office and. Uh, yeah. So I think, right. After I had Pearson. Maybe like nine months, 12 months later is when I got into real estate. I kind of got the opportunity to get my foot in the door and. Decided to take. A risk and go for it, even though it was completely outside my comfort zone, it was something that I had. To like considered. And thought about, but I'm very risk adverse. In certain parts of my life, other parts I'm like, yeah, let's go for it. So when it came to like, OK, how are we going to pay? The Bills you know, is this a smart move for our family? I was. I was a little nervous, but. Yeah, that's kind of how I got my start into real estate. I was a transaction coordinator first for a A-Team locally. And so I did all the paperwork and whatnot. And then I got my real estate license.

Speaker 1

OK, So what year did you get your license again, I can't quite remember.

Speaker 2

2818 OK, 2019 yeah, 2018.

Speaker 1

So you're celebrating about five years now? Yes, that's exciting.

Speaker 2

It's, it's a lot of fun. I love it. It's I always. Tell Alan it's so weird. Doing something that you actually enjoy and not, not just something. That OK, this pays the. Bills you know. I actually really love what I do. And so it makes a difference when you are going to work. You know you're excited to do something. And I love working with my clients and every client is different. And every story is different. And every interaction with them is different, and so it's just always something new and fun. And I love it.

Speaker 1

So you guys have both been working full time since I've known you and I'm sure before that and then you introduced two kids into the mix and then you have a career change that I'm sure was also full time and more. So like with all the extra, I mean getting your license and everything. And then the kids are in sports, right? And you're involved with their sports.

Speaker 2

Yes, we are. We are deep into the volleyball community here. It's like every day we're doing something and soccer. And we were in gymnastics and hula and. Yeah, we do a lot. But I want the girls to figure out what they like. You know, I want them to try different things. And so I told them I'm. Like as long as. You guys are good people and you're keeping your grades up and we're going to support you and help you do what you want to do, you know. You can find what you want to love or. Try things and you don't like it. Well, we're going to finish. It off, we're not going to quit, but. We don't have to do it again. Right. So. So far, Cameron is just all she. Wants to do. Is volleyball. Every day. I'm like I have to check in. With her some days because. I'm like, hey, are, are you still enjoying this? Like we're not. I don't want you to feel like we are pushing you to do this. I want it to be something that. You like and she's like. No, I wish you guys would sign me up. For more, we're like ohh OK. Yeah, she just loves it. So that's kind of cool. And now little sis, of course is. Following in her footsteps. Wants to do all the things that her big sister does so.

Speaker 1

OK, so I want to know the nitty gritty of how you manage your work life around your family life because it seems like that might be. Happening right, you're able to. Schedule around things that are important to you guys.

Speaker 2

Yeah. So. I'll kind of go on a tangent here. So when I my. First year of real Estate, I went hard. Was like I'm not going to fail at this. I'm going to. I'm just going to kill it, right? I almost killed myself.

Speaker 1

Oh man.

Speaker 2

But like I almost burnt myself out that first year because I thought, OK, I have to say yes to everything, right? I have to say. Yes to everyone. That's how I'm going to. Make money and. And you can't live like that. Is what I found out. And so then my second year, I'm like, okay, I have a new goal for myself. I'm gonna try to do. The same amount of business. But I'm going to try to do it less. Stressed out and more. Uh, not terrifying my family, right? I'm like I am not being a nice mom. I'm not being a nice wife. I'm just. I'm just being a good agent. But that's about all I've got going for me. Right now. So my second year I kind of settled down a little bit and I decided I needed to make boundaries, which I think as a real estate agent is super, super important because people will call you at all hours of the day and the week and they will want you to show them houses at 10:00 o'clock at night. And they will call you at 2:00 o'clock in the morning and they will text you and if I answer at all of those times, then that's setting up a boundary to them. Like. Ohh yeah, she'll. She'll take my calls. She'll do whatever. And so I had to learn to. OK. No, I'm not going to answer my phone at this time. Nothing that is happening is an usually nothing that's happening is an emergency and most people. That it would be an emergency for they're not in. The office at those hours anyway. So it can wait until the morning. Is what I had to realize and so. I really, really sat down and said OK, what's important to me, obviously my family. And I wanted to coach Cameron Sports. I wanted to be a part of that is something I always said I wanted. To do so. I was like, well, I'm going to schedule appointments around and I'm going to carve out that time so that I can do that. And I was so nervous that people were going to get so mad at. Me like ohh I'm not I. Don't want to work with. Her because she doesn't have time. For me at that at this exact time, but what I found was that people were like, Oh my gosh, I'm so glad that you're. Taking that time with your family, that's what's important. And I was like ohh. Yeah, most people agree with me on this. And of course every once in a while you get somebody that. Is just like I do not care. And either I would make it work or. I would just find that maybe that's not. A good fit for who I work with, you know? And that's OK. It's OK for me to not say yes to everyone because I have to protect. My boundaries and my family. Or else I'm going to. Either regret things later on because I worked too much, or I'm going to. Burn myself out so. It's a little bit of a challenge for someone like me, that's a people pleaser and I don't like to tell people no and I don't like confrontation, but it's been super healthy for me, I think. And for my family.

Speaker 1

Yeah, I admire so much of what you just shared, and it's so relatable across so many different, I don't know, careers, industries and whatever to set those boundaries. I catch myself finally checking e-mail sometimes at 10:00 PM and I'm like, don't respond right now. Set it as unread, do it in the morning, because if I respond, I'm setting the wrong tone for how I respond to clients, and I know I think you can schedule emails to go out. I'm just not that fancy yet. I'm trying to get there, but yeah, it's so important to have boundaries.

Speaker 2

So yeah, I'm not fancy either I. Don't think I've learned the automated e-mail thing.

Speaker 1

Well, if I figure it out, I'll share. It with you. Thanks. OK, so you have been going for five years now as a licensed agent and I want to hear a little bit about what's happening this year because you shared a little bit with me and I'm excited to hear a little bit more. So with that, I know you recently decided to operate independently. It's very exciting. What are you? What are you excited for with this big change?

Speaker 2

Well, I'm just excited about like. Seeing what I can do, you know. Like I have. Always been on the team since I started. I kind of mentioned I was a transaction coordinator for a team and then it kind of just naturally transition transitioned into me being on that team. And then, you know, I've now been on another team and it's just kind of always been what I've known and it's been that safety blanket for me and so. I just really. Again was like I don't want to regret something later on. I want to try and see if I can do this on my own and if I fail. OK, I'm sure there's a team I can go back. To you know, but. If I don't fail, imagine like. Imagine where I could go with this, you know, and I'm. I'll be. I'll be emotional for a second. Cameron is very, very quiet and very reserved and very. UM risk, adverse and calculated in in everything she does. And she's like exactly me. When I was little. Right and so. I like I have to do something scary. I preach to her all the time about. You got to be louder. You like. You're so funny and everybody loves to hear what you. Have to say. And you're so. Good and confident in what you do, you have to let people see that. And then here I am. You know. Being in the safety blanket of like, oh, this is what it's comfortable. And so how am I supposed to? Tell her to do uncomfortable things. When I'm not. So it finally came down to like, OK. I have to. Do something brave and uncomfortable for me. And then hopefully she'll see that and. After I did it. I came home. And like. It wasn't like a planned thing. I didn't like go into the office planning out like, OK, this is what's gonna happen today. I just was like, you know what? Today I'm gonna be brave. So I. Did it and I came home and I told. Them like, hey, I left the team today. I'm going to be a solo agent now and. The girls were like ohh, we're so excited for you. You know, they were so happy for me. And it's like I didn't even think that they really like got it, you know. And they both totally did and. And so I just, I really AM. Glad that they got. To see me do something that. Was uncomfortable, so. And hopefully that. They can learn from that. And I mean, I haven't seen anything yet. It's only been. Like a week, but. I'm just hoping in the long run that you know it'll help them, you know. Do something brave so. That's what I did and I'm super excited about it. I don't, I don't. I don't necessarily have all. My ducks in a row yet but. I'm really excited about it and. We'll just see where it goes. We'll just. See what it where it goes and I am a hard worker I think I can do this.

Speaker 1

Oh, I know you can do it. You can't. You've talked about being afraid of failing. And I'm like, no. She's not gonna fail. Nope. She doesn't have it in her to let herself fail. You have so much drive and I've, like I said, I've always admired that. And I have goosebumps from hearing you talk about how you're trying to show your girls to step out. You know a step of faith basically and. Just believe in yourself, and anyway your eyes are watering mine. We're starting to people won't see that obviously, but that was a really beautiful moment.

Speaker 2

I can't. I can't even talk about my girls like without crying. Allen laughs at me. Like you just cry about everything now I'm. Like I know they're growing up and. I can't handle anything at all. You can't even watch like shows I. Can't watch the Olympics without crying? I'm like, their parents must be so proud of them. They've worked their whole. It's like, OK, wait, this is not good.

Speaker 1

Just tell him that some leftover, like post-partum hormones. It's fine.

Speaker 2

Yeah. Seven years later.

Speaker 1

Yeah. Ohh man. OK. Well I want to get more into some like daily routine talk. But before we do that, so the real estate industry, I'm sure can be challenging field even you know, especially for newcomers. Do you have any advice that you'd give to someone who's considering a career in real estate while also being a very busy parent? Is there anything, well, you talked about boundaries, but is there anything on top of that?

Speaker 2

Yeah, I mean. I feel like most of the people. In real estate. Are super willing to help you know. Like if I wanted to I could call up any number of agents and we could go to lunch and like for the most part, everyone's pretty open. So if you're thinking about getting into the field. Just invite one of them to lunch or coffee or something and just talk. And I know we all have our different like routines and all of our different. Things that we do, but I'm sure that a lot of them, like for myself, I'll meet with people and talk things through and it doesn't always work out for everyone and it's a hard job. It's hard because yes, it's flexible. Hours wise and I can do a lot of things. With my kids, but also. It does require evenings and weekends, and it's you're never off, right? Like everyone's. If I go on vacation, there's going to be people calling my phone all day long. There's going to be people emailing me all day. Long and yes, you need to have those boundaries, but I think that the community as well like. The real the realtor community is super helpful, and if you find yourself in a in a. Group of. Not necessarily on a team, but if you just become friends or become close with a couple of good ones. It really helps. I have a little group of my little friends that I've been working with for a long time and we look out for each other and you know it's just nice. Like if I need help with something, they're willing to help, it's not like. I mean, for me anyways, I'm not the type of person. That's like I have. To protect my business, I don't want anyone to take it from. Me type. You know I'm. I'm very open and. And willing to help and answer questions and talk. It through and. Like I said, if it's not something that. Works out for them. No big deal, but I'm happy to talk about it. So I think, yeah, just boundaries. And finding a little community to be a part of within it meeting people.

Speaker 1

That is so good. I'm so glad you brought that. Up I really AM and I'm not. I don't. I try my best to not hijack a conversation when I am chatting with guests in their industries and specialties, but I just want to point out the photography industry is very similar to that. Like there's like the stigma that competition needs to be a negative thing. And I understand. Unfortunately, some dynamics it could be, but. It's so it's so important to just try to be, I don't know, the community aspect is so important. Finding your tribe and just chatting and connecting and encouraging. Those who are going through what you're going through because they're the only ones. That don't get. It sharing knowledge and like for an example. We've got a really strong photographer community now, but it didn't used to be that way. From what I've been told. You know, before I was ever involved in it. It's so fun to just. Share knowledge and chat and connect, but also we're always constantly sending referrals, so if you're not the right fit for a client and you know someone who specifically would be or has that specific expertise or experience like, it's so awesome to not. If you can't serve a specific client to be able to find the person who can serve them and. Serve them well so. I'm so glad you. Brought it up. OK, so task wise in life or in business? The home, the kitchen, any of it. Is there anything that you have outsourced that you have no regrets about?

Speaker 2

So my husband? No, I have him do. All the no. I outsourced to my children and my husband a. Lot I am. Not Susie homemaker at all. We are so busy. We are so busy. So a lot of what? We do at home like Alan and I are 100% a team. And so that's super nice in business, I'm kind of finding my own little path now. You know, as I'm going out on my own. So previously, of course, I've had the team, so we would outsource all sorts of things. So I'm trying to pick and choose what I think I might do. As of right now, it's all gonna be me cause I don't want to take on too much. At the beginning of this and then. And then be like, oh, I'm not doing as well as I thought. How am I going to? Pay for these. Things you know. So I'm gonna. I'm gonna do it all on. My own and like. I said I have my background in in transaction coordinating. So it's not anything I'm, you know, nervous about. And of course, I'll have photographers do photos for my properties that I have listed. And all that, I think that's super important, but. Yeah, I think I'll, I'll figure. Out what I what I want to take on and depend on how busy I get, you know, on my own now. I'm not against. Outsourcing it at all. It's just a matter of figuring out what I'll need, I guess down. The road. As far as home life goes and. I don't like to ask. For help so. I do just a lot. Of stuff on our own. We do have, you know, friends that help out with taking the girls, places and stuff if. I'm showing house or whatnot but. Mostly I'm just a chauffeur. People laugh at me all the time. They're like, every time we talk to you, you're in your car. And I'm actually in my car right now talking. To you? So it's like.

Speaker 1

I'm going to point that out.

Speaker 2

I'm in between taking kids places all the time, so I am very great at talking on the phone in the car. Bluetooth all the way. 

Speaker 1

Do you sit and do client emails and whatnot in the car too? Is that a lot of when you are doing communication and admin work?

Speaker 2

Ohh yeah, absolutely, I have my laptop in the passenger seat and we'll just ride around together and when we stop and drop the kids off at various things, I'll get my laptop out and do a couple things and then you know, on to the next thing or just even sitting and waiting for clients so I can get this e-mail. Done real quick.

Speaker 1

I love it. That's the real side. Of being a mompreneur. You just make it happen.

Speaker 2

Yes, it's like you just and Ellen's always like, I don't even know how you do half the things cause. I don't I have this rare problem where I'm like a morning person and I'm a night owl. So like, he's like, when do you sleep? Like I only need. Like 5 hours and I'm good to go. He's the type that needs like a full 8 or he is the worst. Ohh you too.

Speaker 1

That's me. Ohh, that's me. I could not. Well, I have been doing 5 hours here. And there but. I'm in such a grouchy mood and my whole day I need to stop letting that happen because I just. I need to work on that. I'm a grouch.

Speaker 2

He is like she's a grouch too. He is too. And I'm like you must not have gotten enough sleep last night. Just like based off of like 1. Text message from. I'm like, excuse me, but.

Speaker 1

Oh man.

Speaker 2

Yeah. So it's just. I don't know. I just make. It happen. I think that's what we do as moms. Though you know. I'm just like some everyone's always. Like, how do you? Do everything and I'm like, well, not. I'm not, like super organized with it. Mostly it's just pack everything into the car and hope for the best. You know, we're just. I've dropping people off different places. And the nature of real estate is you never know who's going to be calling you or who's going to be needing you at any given time. That my schedule often changes throughout the day, so it's. Just, you know, got to be ready for everything.

Speaker 1

So well, you mentioned chauffeuring a lot and I'm sure you're doing that a lot more because school's out for the summer currently. So looking back to when they were in school or when they will be in. School this coming fall. I would imagine you'd be working from your car a little bit. Do you? Yes, maybe.

Speaker 2

When they're actually in school and I have the whole entire day? Yeah, it's a lot different, definitely. It's actual scheduled time where I make phone calls or I answer emails, you know, it's more routine. The summer is just a free for all. Like, I don't even know. Right now they're at camp this week and it's like a miracle that both of them are at the same camp and I dropped them off at one time and pick them up at one time. But usually it's like OK. Gotta get this person here and that person there and then swap to pick them up and. You know it's all over the place, so. This week's been kind of nice and that's. How it is? For school you. Know they both go. To the same school. Pick them up at the same time and then we go from there. But yeah, summer makes things a little hectic, but it's so fun, you know, doing all the different things so.

Speaker 1

So coming into being an independent agent and not having your previous office space, I'm kind of wondering what that will look like for you meeting with clients, are you? Planning for public spaces like coffee shops and whatnot for any like initial meetings or.

Speaker 2

Uh, no. So. Uh, my brokerage still has like, a drop in drop in desk situation or they have little conference rooms that I can still meet with clients, and if. I need to but yeah, I made a little coffee shops all the time anyways, just because. I like that vibe. So I do a lot of that and then. Yeah, we'll still just, I, I. Told them that I didn't need an office right now just because of the nature of summer and being busy and not really needing to be in the office right now. So we'll see once school starts. If I want to reassess that situation and see if I do want to maybe have. An office, so we'll see but. Right now I'm just doing the drop in.

Speaker 1

OK, so the busy nights. What are you doing for go to dinners if you're trying to. I mean, eating out is a whole different thing. But if you are wanting to have meals at home, but you just don't have time to do it. That night. What are you doing? What's your hack?

Speaker 2

We eat a lot of chicken thighs. I I'll just go to Costco and get like the big packs of. Chicken thighs and. I will cook them in every. Every different way. Instant pot. I'll just. Cook them up on the Crock Pot just so many chicken thighs. If you ask my kids, they'll be like we're sick of chicken thighs but they're so quick and easy and you can do them so many different ways and. They're actually healthy. We don't actually. You're going to this. Is a different side of me. You maybe don't know. We don't actually eat. Fast food like. I don't think I've eaten McDonald's or any of those places in the last 10 years, 12 years maybe. And we don't want to microwave. So a lot of our stuff has to be booked and. That was something I did. When back when I was trying to figure out my hormones and lose weight. And stuff I. Was like, well, anything that needs to be microwaved is not really for me, right? It has all these bad things in it. I maybe regret that now because we can't reheat things very easily. Those girls are like. We can't have popcorn. You know that kind. Of stuff, but. So we just have a lot of. Chicken and meat and veggies. And if we need something super quick like on the go and we go to Costco and get. You know those little? Deli prepackaged things that they have there. That they make. Or those are. That's really just my hacks Costco, Costco, chicken.

Speaker 1

I love it.

Speaker 2

Thighs, Costco meals, whatever.

Speaker 1

OK, so I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit more. So you travel a lot for sports. Is that what you're doing when you're traveling? You're hitting Costco wherever you can.

Speaker 2

Yeah, a lot of the time we do Costco or we'll, you know, we'll bring an ice chest with the sandwich stuff and we'll make sandwiches in the back of the car. That's what we started doing because. Man, I mean, you have the cost of the traveling volleyball and then you have the cost of like getting a hotel room at the various places and then the cost of food for feeding a family of four. It's just it all adds up so. We decided that we just get a little. Ice chest in the back of the car and have some snacks back there. Every once in a while, we'll. Get some, like, Mexican. Food or something while we're out and about. Yeah, we mostly just do the sandwiches and the cooler ideas. And this year we made freezer jam and the girls are obsessed. It like blew their minds that something could be so delicious. So now we just live on peanut butter and Jelly sandwiches?

Speaker 1

I need to try freezer jam. I've never made my own jam and I see all the Mamas.

Speaker 2

It's so good.

Speaker 1

Doing it and I'm like I and they're out picking berries and making the jam and their kids are there with their proud displays and pyramids of glass jars filled and I'm like. I would like to do that at some point in my life. I'm not there. Yet but I.

Speaker 2

Would like to next summer you can you can come. With us and we'll do it.

Speaker 1

Oh, that'd be fun. OK, so self-care, what do you like to do to recharge?

Speaker 2

Ohh man I. I have recently decided that I wanted to be. A reader. So I like to read now I am. I couldn't tell you in the last 12 years how many books I've read. Maybe like 3. You know when you're busy and the young mom. Like there was no time. And so now I'm like, OK, I'm going to read 10 books this year, which is not a very hefty goal. But I was like, listen, I read. Like one last. Year so it's a. Huge amount of a difference, so I've been reading a lot and I like to. Sit in my driveway. In peace, after going to the gym in the morning. And I'll sit. There for like an hour and Allen will see. Me on the camera and. He's like, what are? You doing like. Just taking a moment, it's just a form of self-care, just taking a moment in the car, by myself, I go to the gym. Yeah, Alan and I. Started going to the gym together. Uh, at 5:30 in the morning every weekday. So that's been, umm, really good for my mood, I think in my energy levels, so that's nice. Every once in a. While I'll go and get a facial or something. You know to treat myself but. For the most. Part just making sure that I have. Quiet time where I can turn off my. Brain because I. Struggle with that. A lot, I'm. Always thinking like if I'm driving in my car, there's no music on. I'm just. I don't even notice it like I'm just always thinking of things and my brain is always on. So if I. Have a moment to just sit and. Turn it off and think about something else then. I like to do that.

Speaker 1

I'm glad you have an assortment of self-methods. It's really important. So at night, if you had a free hour for TV time, what's your guilty pleasure TV show?

Speaker 2

Gosh UM, I've really tried to tone back my TV watching a because I. I've got through all the showers. So we like to watch Ted Lasso a lot. I love that show. Schitt's Creek I love, but right now as a family, we just watch volleyball. We watch the USA volleyball teams. That's all we do. So man, if I'm by myself and I get to watch a show. Probably something. Trashy like? I don't know, reality. TV or something Alan hates and I can. Just watch myself, yeah.

Speaker 1

You don't have to wait for him to sit down with you to.

Speaker 2

Keep going on an episode. Exactly, and I don't really have to be paying attention too much. I can just kind of like. Listen to it in the background, maybe.

Speaker 1

And then if you could go back and tell yourself something as a tired, fresh first time parent, what would it be?

Speaker 2

Ohh man that was.

Speaker 1

It was a. Big one.

Speaker 2

A long time ago, probably I would say. To give myself Grace, I would I put. A lot of pressure on. Myself to do everything perfectly because. I was a young mom. And I was the 1st. Of like any. Of the friends that I had to have a kid and so. I didn't have anyone to model my behavior after I was kind of setting it up on my. Own you know. And I was like, I'm gonna do the best of everything. I'm gonna make the baby food, and I'm gonna do all the things absolutely perfect. And I not only did I not succeed at doing. Everything perfect I like. I made myself a little bit crazy and the people around me too, you know, like my family members, they all make fun. Of me still. To this day about how crazy I was. When it came. To Cameron but. Maybe just have a little bit more. Fun with it not be so rigid and. And just realize that like. Babies are babies, and you get this time only for a short 2nd and well, you know, it feels like longer when you're in the moment of crying and all the stuff. But it's so short and. To enjoy it a little bit more and stop putting so much pressure on yourself. Know it's very. Freeing when you realize that there's so many different ways of doing this same thing and it doesn't have to be my what I've created in my brain of being the perfect way of doing it. And I did kind of start to release a little bit of that once we had Pearson. So the second time around it was a little bit different. But also polar. Opposite children, so it was just naturally different. And all the way around so. I think, yeah, just giving myself some grace.

Speaker 1

I had a small moment of realizing how rigid I have been. I mean certain things. It's all like germ focused and whatnot, especially having a kiddo at the beginning of RSV season at the tail end of a pandemic. That was interesting. But just recently I just. So my husband had her. I don't remember what I was doing. I must have been out of the House or something. But he had her and he just followed her. He's like, OK, whatever she wants to go and do, I'm going to do so. He just became her shadow and was there for, of course, safety, but letting her just explore the house, walk through baby gates, break those boundaries. Go outside like she went up to her boots, put on her boots so he's like, OK, we're going outside. So then he just followed her. Around outside for a while and then they came back in. And I'm just sitting here like I box her. Into my day. Every day, I mean most days like I. And anyway, you just gave me a whole different outlook to let go a little bit and let her take the lead. And anyway, that's something I'm working on right now. So love that you said that.

Speaker 2

Yeah. I mean even. Even with Cameron being 12, I'm kind of revisiting this now because she's going to be a teenager this year, right? Well, I want her to stay my little first born. Sweet, innocent child. I have to realize I can't protect her from everything and I can't shelter her from everything or she's gonna. Be a weirdo. You know, so I have to like let go with some things, but I mean I I'm crazy when it comes to like car seats. OK, that's my thing. You're just germs. And I drove her to 5th grade and. She got out of school the first day. And she goes. Wait, can I please not ride in a car seat anymore? No one else is running in one and I'm bigger than everybody. Else and I still AM. I was. Like ohh OK, you know, it's probably time you. Know to get rid of the. Car seat. But like things like, just letting her go and do her own thing, it's very, very scary for me specifically for her. Because it's my first time with doing any of this new stuff. And half the time I'm telling now and. I'm like, I don't know. Who decided that we were qualified to do this? Because I don't know what I'm doing and. We won't know that we messed her up until it's happened. You know we won't know until later. So I'm just like. I don't know. How to tell what the? What the right and wrong thing is? To do at this. Age and it's very scary, but it's also so cool to kind of be going into this new. New stage of our relationship where it's less of like me always having to get her in trouble or, you know, not that that she was ever in trouble. She's like the perfect little Angel child. Right. But she. UM, she gets to be a part of discussions now and she gets to start having more responsibility and it's just a different dynamic with us now and it's super fun and I love it. And it's like, yes, I'm mourning this little like baby side of her and this little child side of her. But it's so exciting to see. What this new stage is going to be? UM, but it's so hard. To let go and, like, let her. Go off and do her own thing. And I'm thinking, you know, couple of years down the road driving I oon't let her ride with hardly anybody in a car so I can't even imagine her, like actually driving a car. So just those, it's like, ohh gosh, we're coming into some weird changes. You know, so. We will be OK.

Speaker 1

We only have a two-year-old and we are so neurotic with everything like. I won't name names, but we've got some family members that are like her dad needs to chill, or you guys need to chill. She'll be OK.

Speaker 2

Yeah, my family has said that about me. For 12 years.

Speaker 1

I'm like, OK, certain things. I'm pretty adamant on. But I do understand that, OK, we need to be a little more relaxed. Not always think worst case scenario.

Speaker 2

So far. Yes, that is 100% my brain. I go worst case instantly before I ever even think of anything good that could happen from it. It's all bad.

Speaker 1

Oh man. OK, so do you guys have anything that you guys are really looking forward to in the next couple of years like any goals or projects in the works for your family home business, anything.

Speaker 2

Yeah, I mean, obviously my plan. Is to succeed it. In business, but we as a family have just kind of really. Found a love for travel? So we're gonna plan some more trips and do some more things. It's just so fun to make memories in that way and. I just feel like. It's healthy. For the girls to get out and see different cultures and see different. And so we're going to do some more of that and. Gosh, what else are we going to do? Who knows? I'm probably. You know, we have all. These dreams about. All sorts of projects, so we'll see what we. Actually end up doing but. I know, yeah. Mostly travel. We just want to travel.

Speaker 1

Traveling is definitely on my list once she's passed the toddler stage.

Speaker 2

Ohh gosh yeah.

Speaker 1

I see a lot of people do it with toddlers, with infants, and they make it work, but we've got a kiddo who melts down by like 6:30 PM and I just don't know how he would do it.

Speaker 2

Yeah, it I. I always am like, wow, you guys are brave. I get such anxiety. Like if my kid is starting to cause other people, any kind of, you know, feel any kind of way. Like if mines crying, I'm like sweating and panicking like we need to get out of there. So being trapped on like an airplane. With that, I. Just I wouldn't do well. So I'm like good for you guys and like it doesn't bother me that your kids crying, but I. Would be panicking, right?

Speaker 1

Now, yeah. Yeah, well, that'll be fun to follow along and watch you guys travel and explore. It's been fun so far cause and you guys have been. OK. Well, as we wrap up, if you'd like to allow listeners to follow or connect with you, can you tell us where to find you?

Speaker 2

So I have a business page on Facebook, just Karissa Pangelina Real Estate Agent is the name of the page. I'm working on a new website so that should be going live here in the next couple of weeks and. Yeah, just exciting new stuff. Ohh, big changes.

Speaker 1

Well, we'll put the link to the Facebook page in the notes and then encourage people to follow along there so that they can be updated with your official website when it's released.

Speaker 2
