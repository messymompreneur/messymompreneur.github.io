### Episode Transcription

Hello and welcome to the second episode of the Messy Mompreneur Podcast. I'm your show host, Alysha Sanford, and I'm so happy to have you here. I'm currently recording during my daughter's nap and crossing my fingers that she takes a longer one today. If you know the nap time, hustle, struggle, you know how crucial each minute is. Mother's Day is this coming weekend, so I wanted to take this opportunity to share a few thoughts with you regarding the holiday. I'll also be sharing eight great ways to find time for self-care as a busy mom. I come from a split family and I have been blessed with four different mother figures all local to us. I'm grateful to be able to celebrate this holiday now as a mama myself because for a while I wasn't sure if I'd ever get to wear that title, so I try my hardest not to take it for granted. We experienced infertility and finally sought some answers in late 2020. In early 2021, we were lucky to find ourselves expecting Veda, our sweet baby girl. Despite a traumatizing birth experience, I'll never forget those first few days of delirious, hormonal bliss while snuggling our tiny baby girl at home. Coming into motherhood has been humbling on so many levels. I've experienced so many highs and lows. As I mentioned in the previous episode, I wanted to be a mama since I was a little girl. I told my husband that it would likely be the hardest thing that I'll ever do and I couldn't have been more spot on. But it is so insanely rewarding, the little girl is my everything. I know that this holiday can carry a lot of different emotions for many. Wherever you find yourself this Sunday, I hope that you're able to have the most beautiful day celebrating, honoring, and or remembering the extra special women in your lives. I really want to encourage you to acknowledge your needs or wishes for the holiday and to communicate them with your loved ones. Looking beyond this holiday, taking care of yourself in general, helps you to be a better mom and partner and helps you handle the stresses of life with more ease. Find what works for you and make self care a priority. So with that, I want to share eight ways to find time for self care as a busy mom. Now these might feel like a no-brainer, but I loved the reminders and I really need to implement these more often. Number one, schedule it in. One of the best ways to find time for self care is to schedule it in, whether it's a weekly yoga class, a quarterly massage, or a daily 10 minute breath work session, make self care a priority by scheduling it into your calendar. Number two is not my favorite because I'm not a morning person, but wake up earlier or go to bed later. You can use this alone time to do something that you enjoy, such as reading, taking or relaxing bath, watching a favorite TV show, or doing a quick workout. Number three, ask for help. Ask your partner or family to watch the kids. Higher a babysitter, or even trade off babysitting days with the fellow mama. Inlisting some help can give you the time that you need for self care. Number four, multitask. Look for ways to multitask so that you can take care of yourself while also taking care of your kids. For example, while on a stroller walk, you could pop a near button and listen to a podcast or your favorite music. You can do a workout while your kids play nearby. You can listen to your favorite show, podcast or music while doing household chores, or running errands, etc. Number five, simplify your routine. Simplify your routine so that you have more time for self care. For example, you could meal prep on the weekends to save time during the week, or you could outsource housework to a cleaning service if that's within your means. You could also remove things from your overloaded plate, just start learning to say no. Number six, set priorities. Make a list of the things that are most important to you and prioritize self care. Number seven, delegate tasks. Despite what many of us mama's tell ourselves you don't have to do everything yourself. Have an honest conversation with your partner or even family members and delegate some of the tasks that you're needing help with. And finally, number eight, use your time wisely. Use the time that you do have to take care of yourself. Stop the social media scroll, set your phone down and do something that fills your cup. Remember, self care is not selfish, it's necessary. It doesn't have to involve a big time-consuming activity. Once more acts of self care such as taking a few deep breaths can make a big difference in how you feel. The key is to prioritize self care and make it a regular part of your routine. Okay, so before we wrap up today, I want to recap those eight ways to find time for self care as a busy mom. Number one, schedule it in. Number two, wake up earlier or go to bed later. Number three, ask for help. Number four, multitask. Number five, simplify your routine. Number six, set priorities. Number seven, delegate tasks. And finally, number eight, use your time wisely. If you haven't already, I'd be so grateful if you'd take a minute to subscribe to the podcast and leave a review. If you'd share this podcast with others that may find it helpful, that would also be incredibly appreciated. I'd really love to connect with you on social media. So shoot me a DM with any specific topics that you want to hear more about or with questions that you'd like me to ask the fellow mompreneurs during guest interviews coming up. You can find me on most platforms with the handle at Messy. I'll share my contact info in the show notes as well. Thank you so much for spending some of your valuable time with me today. I can't wait to share the next episode with you. I'll be having a conversation with a good friend of mine that I have so much respect for, and I'm so excited to chat all about the messy and the beautiful world of Mompreneurship with her. You won't want to miss it. And if you're a local listener, you might recognize her. Alright, friend, I hope you have a great week and a wonderful Mother's Day weekend.
