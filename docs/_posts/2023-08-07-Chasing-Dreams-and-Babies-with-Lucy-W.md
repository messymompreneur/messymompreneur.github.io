Hello and welcome back!

In today’s conversation, we are chatting with my friend Lucy Wang. I met Lucy in person at a photography workshop years ago and collaborated with her for a bit when we both dabbled in the newborn prop industry. She is a wife and mama of 3 residing in the LA area. She's also a self-proclaimed iron chef, SYSK binge-listener, and crazy plant lady. You will most likely find her in her kitchen cooking for her family. Otherwise, she is tending to her indoor jungle, heading to a hip-hop class, browsing the aisles at Trader Joe's, or entertaining in her backyard. Occasionally you might find her, camera in hand, helping other families document those small but significant moments in life.
