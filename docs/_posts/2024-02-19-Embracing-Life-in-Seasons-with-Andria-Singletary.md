### Episode Transcription

Speaker 1

Hello and welcome back to the Messy Mompreneur podcast, a show where we chat all about navigating the beautiful mess of raising babies and businesses. If you're seeking encouragement, tips, and time saving hacks to avoid overwhelm in your busy home parenting and work life, you're in good company. I'm your host, Alysha Sanford. I'm a photographer and toddler momma in Southern Oregon and I'm so happy to have you here. Today we're chatting with Andria Singletary. She's a wife, mom of two, as well as a life and business coach for mompreneurs. On her podcast, Mama Turned Mompreneur, she talks about all things motherhood and business life. Her biggest passion is helping other moms build a business that fits their current season of life. Because, let's be honest, life as a mom is ever changing. And finding what aligns with you is key. She takes pride in helping her clients succeed and grow their clientele off social media, through podcasting and other strategies so they can spend less time on their phones and more time with their littles. All right, friend, let's dive in. Welcome, Andria. Thank you so much for joining me for our conversation today.

Speaker 2

Thank you for having me.

Speaker 1

So I've listened to your podcast for a while now, but my listeners may not know who you are, so I would love it if you would kick us off by telling us a little bit about you, your life, your business, all the good stuff.

Speaker 2

Sure. So yeah, my name is Andria Singletary, and I'm a wife. I'm a. Mom, I have two little ones. A soon to be two year old and four year old, which is crazy to say and they are both home with me pretty much full time. I'm also a life and business coach for moms. I have been in the online space almost three years now. Started out as a virtual assistant. Eventually niched in the podcast management and then recently added in life and business coaching to better serve my community. But yeah, that's a little bit about me.

Speaker 1

We are both in the thick of toddler hood. My daughter is like coming up on 2 1/2 and my goodness we are feeling the toddler struggle lately. Yes, and you are very seasoned in that it sounds like.

Speaker 2

Yes, yes, my daughter. She's the youngest one and she has, I like to say she has a really big personality. She's very spirited. Yeah, we have those struggles very, very strong, willed, so I totally get it.

Speaker 1

So can we talk a little bit more about? I guess kind of your journey as far as coming into motherhood and entrepreneurship, like which specifically came first and how you navigated it as you were starting coming into motherhood.

Speaker 2

Yeah. So I became a mom first before having kids and joining the online space and all of that. I worked in the early childhood field. So I worked from preschool teacher assistant up to a director. And so I got pregnant with my son in 2019, had him at the height of the pandemic. So April 2020. So, like, literally in the beginning of the pandemic. And while I was on maternity leave, I actually had no intention of returning to my job. I knew that I wanted to be home. Once I started having kids but it worked out that my job actually shut down due to the pandemic. So got to be home and so like that first year was just focusing primarily on my son. And he got older. We decided to put him in childcare so he could start, you know, socializing with other kids his age. And so I was like, OK, I need something for myself. So I started out like doing like a mom blog, sharing what it was like being a mom during pandemic a first time mom during the pandemic and all of that, and I really love building my first website and so I was like, OK, maybe I can do something with this. And so I landed a web design client, really enjoyed it, but I was like, I need more structure like I need to like really figure out this online thing. So just going down like a Google rabbit hole, I discovered virtual assistants and so, October, what was it, 2021, I think, yeah. I launched my virtual assistant business. Now, mind you, my son was one. And then I was also 12 weeks pregnant with my daughter. So. I decided to start a business while pregnant and yeah, that was that was a lot of fun, but I knew that I'm like, I wanted to really make something with this. And so that's when I launched the Savvy VA Mama really enjoyed it. I was able to serve a lot of mom business owners. But I found myself quickly burned out because I was offering literally anything you can offer as a virtual assistant. So web design, general admin blog, copywriting. Social media management, even though I hated. Like just doing all of these things. And so I was like, OK, I really need to niche down. I need to find something, that one I'm going to enjoy, but that's going to make sense for my life because I was transitioning into becoming a mom of two, and I was literally going to have two under 2. So I was like, I have to do things differently. And so, I at that time I was listening to a lot of mom podcasts, really kind of just leaning into that for like a sense of community. And so I was like, OK, who supports these women with getting their podcasts out into the world? And so I again went down a Google rabbit hole, discover Lauren Wrighton. She had the podcast manager program really loved that. She was also a mom and she was building this successful business with her girls at home with her. And so I was like, OK, let's do this. Let's go for it so. So my goal was to finish the course before I went into labor with my daughter. And so literally a week before I went into Labor, I finished the course. Then I. Had my daughter. And then I was like, OK, I need to find clients. And so I actually landed a client probably a few weeks after I had my daughter. It was actually one of my former virtual assistant clients, so I started supporting her with managing her podcast and then just kind of went in that direction. And one of the things that I found was that a lot of business owners who had podcasts, they were treating their podcasts as the separate thing. They weren't really using it as an effective part of their marketing strategy. And so I was like, OK, we got to fix this. Like, you already have a lot on your plate as a business owner. And having a podcast is a lot of work, so it's like, let's use it to your advantage. Yet let's use it as a way to bring in new leads and nurture your audience and everything and prime them for your offers. And so that's what I really started focusing on with supporting my clients. So really leaning into that. Strategy side of podcasting and podcasting for your business and everything. And so that's kind of like what I was focusing on. And then my kids started to get a little bit older and. And recently shared about this on my podcast. But we found out that my son has autism and so that added in this new layer of navigating motherhood and entrepreneurship. And as much as I love supporting women with launching their podcast and you know, really helping them use it as an effective part of their marketing. Strategy I no longer had the capacity for it and so. I was like, OK, how can else can I support my community but do it in a way that actually aligns with my current season of life? And so that's when I decided to pursue coaching. And The funny thing is that I technically had already been coaching my clients, and I even had clients tell me that I was like their first coach and everything. Even though that wasn't a title that I claimed or anything like that. That and so, yeah, I decided to launch life in seasons coaching and it's really allowed me more time. Freedom One I'm able to support my clients in a way that I enjoy and that's truly benefiting them. But also I love it. I have more time. You know to better support my kids, especially with my son like we have OT speech all these different things. And so it's giving me more of the flexibility that I need in order to, in a sense, build this business that fits my current season of life. And so that's kind of like how I'm navigating all of this. Like it's evolved, it's changed so much. But one of the things I really lean into is just flexibility and really looking at what my needs are and what my family's needs are and always like keeping that at the top of mine. As I'm like doing different things in my business as I'm looking at what changes I can make in every.

Speaker 1

There is so much that I want to say and I know I'm going to forget the different topics I want to talk to. You about because. We don't have all day, but my goodness. So I've been listening to your show. I've been well, I've been the majority of it. I think there's a few episodes I haven't quite caught up with, like somewhere in the middle. But I remember I found you and I was binging it for all of the episodes regarding building a podcast, starting a podcast. And you know, nurturing that and I am probably a prime candidate for needing. Needing to. Follow through with coaching as far as how to connect it and make it make sense with your offers for my audience, but not quite there yet. But I then found myself more connected to any episodes where you would touch on motherhood and it just it's funny that you say that you were coaching without realizing it because you were you were coaching. Ian, you didn't realize it, and I just like. I clung to all of your encouragement as far as. Working your business around your home and family and motherhood life. And anyway, it's just been very inspiring. So I'm so excited to be talking to you because of that specifically.

Speaker 2

Well, thank you. For sharing that.

Speaker 1

Appreciate it. Sorry fangirling. I'm not being very. I don't know. Anyway. Yeah. Like I said, there's so much that I want to talk to you about. Like the life in seasons. Part 2. I think that's been like an underlying theme before. You even like coined that as your course in coaching. Am I remembering correctly that you had talked a little bit about ADHD? Yes. OK, yes. If you're comfortable sharing with us a little bit, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how that played in during those seasons of motherhood and finding your footing with your business. Keeping everything afloat.

Speaker 2

Yeah. So I like many women I didn't realize I had ADHD because I was always like a top student. I was like, always really on top of things. But now I realize it was masking. But it wasn't until I transitioned to a mom of two where literally I was just dropping the ball on. Everything for getting appointments and all these different things. And I'm like, what is going on with me, like, that's not who I am and what not. And I had finally reached this point where I was just so overwhelmed, like mentally and emotionally and whatnot. And I was like, OK, something is going on here. Like something is not quite right. And so I'm just talking to one of my. Friends and business, she kind of like I shared with her what was going on and she was like, I think you may have ADHD. And so she gave me all of these resources and I again went down the rabbit hole and really just learning more about what it looks like in women, especially moms and different things like that. And so a lot of it was just coming to terms with the fact. This is something that's a part of me now and it was hard. I found myself one time like we typically do our grocery shopping on Sundays. And so it was like time for me to make the grocery list and typically, like, I will, like, make the list for, like, the stuff I need for me and the stuff for the kids. And then my husband. Kind of like, you know, makes his own little. List or whatever. And literally, I was just standing in the kitchen frozen like I could not think I could not move. And I was like, I don't know what to do. Like, I know what I'm supposed to be doing, but the mental load of it all was just so much that I was just frozen and I, like, broke down crying. And so, like, my husband, he came and comforted me. And he's like, you know what? I'll plan out the stuff and everything like that. But it was like that. The moment was kind of like. My breaking point to a certain extent, but also realizing that OK, I need additional supports like I see that these are areas that I'm not the strongest in, and so how can I better navigate it? So for me that looked like buying a book that had no plans. And really leaning into Pinterest so that way I'm not having to come up with meals and stuff now. It's still challenging because having a child with autism, they are very, very picky eaters. Literally my son lives off of chicken Nuggets, applesauce and Graham cracker. I don't know how he's still gaining weight, but it's working right now. But also just looking at restructuring my business like I realized I was taking on too much in my business and that was also impacting my mental capacity. So I. Going into 2024. I knew I was going to be doing less podcast launches, which is why I navigated to hosting the get it done week where I support female entrepreneurs with launching their podcast in seven days. I give them all the tools and the resources that they need, but they also have access to me. Via telegram, where I providing any coaching and different things like that, but it took a lot of that mental load off of me because I'm not doing it for them. I'm walking alongside them and even two I like capped my monthly management clients for right now. And so just like again, like making those shifts, making those changes to kind of better navigate all of this, because I'm like I 2023, it's like I found out I have ADHD and then found out my son has autism and I think he might be comorbid with ADHD. Because I see uh some similar behaviors in him too. So it was. Like a lot to navigate, but I knew that I needed to build my business in a way that's going to allow for the flexibility that I would need, especially I know that they're like by. 2:00 I am done for the day. I do. I can't. Like, I'm tired. I don't have the mental capacity to really do anything. And so making those adjustments where I'm not scheduling any meetings or anything like. That after that time or around that time, so really looking at like what can I change and do to better support my needs and how my brain works and everything like that. And then you told me about the capture the Chaos Planner, which has been such a godsend. Like, I have never stuck with a planner. This long and I have I you. You could look at it. I haven't skipped the day yet this year and it feels so good because I'm not over stuffing my list and so I literally every day just about like able to check everything off my list for the day and just having a clear picture, a clear view of. Like OK, this is what I'm focusing on today and different things like that. So yeah, just having those supports makes a world of a difference.

Speaker 1

I resonate so much with that, so I didn't really ever pay attention to the. Tendencies of mine or the challenges of mine that now that I know now that I know that they exist and it's definitely inattentive ADHD, I'm like. I could have. I could have sought support so much earlier on and so many aspects of my life would have been so I don't know so much less messy. And that's kind of why I named my show Messy Mompreneur because yeah, that is me. And then I also didn't do a good job honoring the season of life I was in when I was coming into motherhood. And I've shared with you before that I just I didn't have systems in place. I didn't do a good job preparing for it, putting supports in place. I just. Hot mess express, but I love that you are offering support and coaching. In so many aspects of life, to be honest, because they all kind of. Overlap. And I love that you're offering support. So as far as your coaching goes for the life and seasons, I know that that isn't more recent offering. Could you give us like a quick overview of, I guess the different stages of that coaching process in case any listeners wanted to look into it?

Speaker 2

Yeah. So basically it's a minimum of a six month commitment, but you get support in one we have monthly calls via zoom and that is where we really map out your action plan for the upcoming month. I've found that. And my clients breaking things down month by month is a lot more manageable. Instead of like trying to plan out a whole quarter or a whole six months at once and everything. So we really look at like what are your goals, what do you want to focus on and creating an action plan that's going to support with that. My clients also get access to me via Voxer. It's like unlimited boxer coaching during my business. Hours and we're able to work through a lot of different things that come up as they are building their business and navigating the challenges of motherhood and different things like that. And getting just feedback on content. And one of the things I'm really big on is supporting my clients with building their business off of social media. So we look at, OK, what is that going to be for you? Is it going to be podcasting? Is it going to be blogging? Is it going to be e-mail marketing and different things like that? I'm really just getting them thinking about. How to move away from social media? Because let's be real when it comes to social media, if you want to see results, you have to post quite a bit, you know, to stay top of mind and everything and. So we really. Lean into long form content collaborations, different things like that to ensure that one. They are getting in front of their ideal clients but also creating this Evergreen content that's going to continue to work for them even when they're not showing up on social media so. We have that and then also there are different training modules. Pretty much you get access to my entire business brain in these training modules. Everything that I have learned and have really found to support moms with building a sustainable business and doing it in a way. That's not going to have you burnt out. That's not going to. Have you feeling mom guilt because you have to choose between business or being present for your children? It's really showing you how to build a business that fits your current season of life, so you get access to all of that. Also, there's like different special bonuses. So like for instance. For my clients who want to watch a podcast they can join, they get it done week for 50% off. So there's a lot of perks and everything but that overall that's kind of the breakdown of the life and seasons coaching.

Speaker 1

I love that you are focused on taking the pressure off of being on social media because especially this year I feel like I'm seeing more and more people taking breaks from it, which is so awesome and I haven't done it yet. I need to. I just haven't I yeah, I'm getting there, but I think it is amazing to remind people to go back to their long. Long form content because of the Evergreen nature, but also. You can still repurpose that stuff into your scheduled social media posts if you want to. You know, if you want to keep up your presence and I just it's been a game changer for me since I discovered that a couple of months ago. And so anyway, I love that you're guiding people that direction too because it is. Such a breath of fresh air having an actual plan when you go to social media, so you don't just get sucked into posting whatever because you're panicking. There's a bigger picture, yeah. Well, thank you for sharing a bit about your coaching offer and I'll make sure to link that in the show notes because it sounds amazing and all-encompassing to be honest. Yes. So I you mentioned the capture, the Chaos Planner, would you say it's one of your time management hacks as of now?

Speaker 2

Oh, definitely. Basically how I do it. The night before each day, I really look at like what my top priorities are, and I love that Brittany has that section with like your top three priorities, and it helps me stay focused because as we know with ADHD, it's like shiny object syndrome. You could go all over the place, but that really helps me to focus like, OK, what are the top three things that? I have to get done tomorrow, so it really helps me stay on track with that, but also just. Breaking it down day by day instead of trying to map out my entire week has been really helpful. And also I'm a visual person, so being able to look at the planner to see like, OK, this is what I have to focus on and get done today and everything. So it's definitely helped me so much with my time. Even just like not working as much in my business like yesterday, I probably worked a couple of hours like we had a lot going on like I worked out in the morning and then I was able to take my son to his OT appointment and like, do a few other things. And then couple times I like sent an e-mail. I did something real quick and stuff, but like I didn't get behind on my business work. So it was really it's like really helpful and like staying organized and really just being better at managing my time in general.

Speaker 1

Yeah, I love that we both have it because we can talk about it, cause otherwise it's just me talking to people about this thing that I got and they don't understand it. But it's, yeah, it's been a game changer for me. It's actually upstairs on my kitchen table and I come back to it so many times throughout the day and my husband, he's so much more of a digital calendar guy and we have a shared calendar between the two of us. But I don't put all my To Do List stuff and that. Because then I'm just on my phone more and it. I get so. Distracted. And then I end up on social media scrolling so having a different place to come back to so frequently and check things off. And yeah, it's been awesome. Is there anything else that you would say that you have found has been really? Helpful. As far as I don't know anything that you've automated or batched or outsourced recently?

Speaker 2

UM, so I have been really leaning into building Evergreen funnels and it's been so fun, like planning them and different things like that. But I feel that as a mom because our time and our capacity is limited, if you were. Be able to have a way where things are working in the background where you're bringing in new leads and. Converting them into, you know, different offers. It makes a world of a difference because you don't have to always be on. You know, we're told that we need to be selling daily and different things like that. But the reality is that as a mom. You may not be able to do that. You may not be able to show up on socials daily to sell and different things like that. So I found having those funnels working for you in the background is such a game changer, especially like if you're wanting to get into like creating more digital products and different things like that, creating really good e-mail funnels. Is going to be a game changer for you.

Speaker 1

This is a little above my head, something that I'm getting towards. I know that it's necessary and it's it sounds amazing. I'm still trying to understand the funnel process and building it out and whatnot, but. That sounds. Just incredible, to be honest. Yes, I have a few questions that are a bit more mom related as opposed to business. Do you have any go to dinners or meal plans that you go to for the busy days that are feeling a little chaotic?

Speaker 2

Yeah, I'm for my kids typically can't go wrong with breakfast for dinner, and so we will do different things, like pancakes. Sometimes we'll do waffles. Sometimes we'll do cereal. But yeah, that is kind of like one of my go TOS. Especially like if I'm really tired and I just, I don't really feel like cooking a full meal. So yeah, I have a few recipes. Oh my gosh, I'm forgetting the like her. Instagram handles like toddler or something like toddler mills or something like that, but she has like this really easy pancake recipe that my kids absolutely love. Even my husband loves it too, so I will, you know, kind of go to that, like, have basically those ingredients on hand. So that way if it's one of those days, I can easily like whip up quite a few pancakes and I'll freeze them. A bunch of them. So that way I always have them to pull from if I don't feel like cooking a full meal.

Speaker 1

Freezer meals are my jam. Yeah, they are lifesavers. That's funny that you said breakfast for dinner because we just did that for the first time in what feels like a year. I don't. We did biscuits and, like, biscuits and gravy. Eggs. I think even tater tots and then a side of veggies to make it healthy. It was. It was a.

Speaker 2

Yes, yes.

Speaker 1

Like just? Lifesaver that night, yeah. Self-care, I want to know how you make time for self-care and what that looks like. For you.

Speaker 2

Yes. So right now that looks like for me, when my husband gets home from work, he takes over with the kids. So typically, like the kids will eat earlier because my husband gets home pretty late from work and then him and I will have dinner and then he takes care of the night time routine. And so I go and I. Take a nightly bubble. Laugh usually about an hour reading a good book. Have my kombucha with me and so that right now, for this season of life is my self-care and it really just allows me to kind of wind down, but also just you know the over stimulation we experience as moms is being able to have an hour. Just to myself, no one's saying. Mom. Mommy, I want this. I want apple. No one climbing all over me. It's been really helpful in me for me, like, just. To kind of just have a clear mind and have some quiet around me and everything. But yeah, that's kind of my self-care routine. And then when we have someone to watch the kids, me and my husband will do a date night or I will go hang out with friends and everything. But yeah, my daily self-care is my nightly bubble baths.

Speaker 1

I am glad to hear that you have a regular routine for that cause not everybody does and I know it's important. Yes, yes. Fill up your own cup. TV time. Do you get a lot of that? Do you have any guilty pleasure TV shows?

Speaker 2

So right now, me and my husband, we are watching chosen. We're on season three. Yeah, as far as, like, a lot of my shows haven't come back yet like. I love Bridgerton and. UM. Oh, you, I thought the new season was supposed to come out this month and then they changed it. But yeah, a lot of my shows aren't back yet. I watch a lot of different Netflix shows, but it's hard when it's like so much time in between seasons and everything. And then I had started to rewatch The Vampire Diaries. And then. And I think I got bored with.

Speaker 1

It again, I don't think I ever finished that one, but I remember being hooked on it for a long time.

Speaker 2

Yeah, I made it like halfway through the first time and then I just stopped and then I was like, OK, this time I'm going to finish it. And I made it a little bit further than I did the first time I started watching it. But I didn't finish it.

Speaker 1

So yeah. OK, I know that this is a big question like it can feel like I don't know a lot of pressure, but if you could go back and tell yourself something as a tired, fresh first time Mama, what would it be?

Speaker 2

That you are more than enough. When I had my son like the whole, the birth experience was traumatic and then our start was very challenging and so I felt like it kind of set the tone, not in a good way. And I was just constantly questioning if I was doing this right. I was doing that right, you know, and my. Talking to him enough and different things like that, especially as we started to see signs of a speech, delay and everything. And so for the longest I had a lot of guilt. Like I didn't talk to him enough or maybe I gave him too much screen time and all these different things. And then. We had my daughter and she started picking up on language so quickly and everything and literally the same things I did with my son. I did with her. And I was like, OK, you didn't do anything wrong. And then, you know, we got the diagnosis for autism and stuff for my son. And it all made sense. But like, we just got that diagnosis end of last year. So I literally have had this mom guilt all this time, wondering if I did something wrong with my son. Or messed up somewhere or something like that. And so if I could go back, you know, when I first became a mom, I would tell myself that you are more than enough. You know, because I am. I did the things I was supposed to do. My kids know that they are loved. They're WellCare for and I pour into them and I, you know, especially having that child development background that was also like looming over me too. But knowing that I didn't make. Many mistakes. I did what I was supposed to do and so just really if I could go back and tell myself that that's what it was.

Speaker 1

Mommy Gill is a beast and I. Yeah, I think that we all need to get something printed and have it in every room in the house that says you are more than enough. So that is very, very. Yeah, that's a good reminder. Thank you. Yes. Well, looking forward to the next couple years, is there any? I don't know home life business projects that you're excited.

Speaker 2

Yeah. So we are hoping to buy our first home this year, just hard because we are in California and it is ridiculously expensive out here trying to get my husband to get on board with moving out of state. We'll see, but that's something I'm looking forward to, we definitely. We need a larger space and I want to be able to have an actual office. Instead of having to record in my closet, but that's something I'm looking forward to and then just being able to travel with my family more with something me and my husband have been talking more about just wanting to take the kids to experience different places. Different cultures and different things like that. So that's something I'm looking forward to as well.

Speaker 1

Well, I'm up in Oregon, so if you ever make it this way, let me know. I'm in southern. Oregon. So it's not at the top of the state.

Speaker 2

Yes. Yeah, yeah, definitely.

Speaker 1

Well, as we wrap up is if you'd like to allow any listeners to follow or connect with you, can you tell us how?

Speaker 2

Yeah. So I have my podcast monitor mom for newer. So you could definitely check that out. As you've heard, it's a pretty great podcast, especially if you are. Hey, Mom, running and then also I am on Instagram at mamaturnedmompreneur not super active, but if you dear me, I will respond and then my website is mamaturnedmompreneur.com.

Speaker 1

Awesome. We'll put those links in the show notes and I can vouch that you do respond. I know you say you're not on socials, but you are always very diligent about responding. Yes, thank you. No problem. Well, thank you so much for joining me for conversation. I've been really looking forward to it and I appreciate your patience in the illness rescheduling of your graciousness. No problem. Trust me, I get it. I just had to e-mail someone to reschedule because I didn't realize the day we were going to record.

Speaker 2

My son has a minimum day so.

Speaker 1

And so hard balancing him, yeah.

Speaker 2

Yes, yes. The funny thing is that he already goes to school half day. So, like, how can he have a minimum day when he already goes to school? Minimum day. But that's neither here nor there.

Speaker 1

Yeah. It's like a micro day. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.

Speaker 2

It really does it.

Speaker 1

Well, thank you again so much and I hope you have an awesome rest of your Tuesday.

Speaker 2

Thank you. Alright, bye.
